# TheTwistingHaunt
Text-Based RPG
The Twisting Haunt is a text-based rpg whose code repository can be found at http://www.thetwistinghaunt.com

The Twisting Haunt was originally envisioned as a final project for a low level CS class at Winona State University to properly showcase the use of abstraction and interfaces. The Twisting Haunt also heavily utilized polymorphism, recursion, and gracefully showcased the power of an object-oriented programming language.

The Twisting Haunt has since evolved, involving members from various universities and graduates. The core of the game is still the same - write a text based rpg where the user can traverse instances (and potentially open-world), battle foes, complete quests, and enjoy a compelling and horrifying story.
