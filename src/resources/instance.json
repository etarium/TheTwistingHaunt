* instance_id and isCompleted will be indexed.
* The Instance document is meant to be loaded first, with the instance_id being
* a consumable object to begin querying cell arrays.
* updated is to be compared with a local updated object on "load", if they
* do not match, then a new query to the database should be loaded.
